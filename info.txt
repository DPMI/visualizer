<b>Introduction</b>
Having access to relevant and up-to-date measurement data is a key issue for network analysis in order to allow for efficient Internet performance monitoring, evaluation and management. New applications keep appearing; user and protocol behavior keep evolving; traffic mixes and characteristics are continuously changing, which implies that traffic traces may have a short span of relevance and new traces have to be collected quite regularly.

In order to give a holistic view of what is going on in the network, passive measurements have to be carried out at different places simultaneously. On this background, this paper proposes a passive measurement infrastructure, consisting of coordinated measurement points, arranged in measurement areas.
This structure allows for a efficient use of passive monitoring equipment in order to supply researchers and network managers with up-to-date and relevant data. The infrastructure is generic with regards to the capturing equipment, ranging from simple PCAP-based devices to high-end DAG cards and dedicated ASICs, in order to promote a large-scale deployment of measurement points.
